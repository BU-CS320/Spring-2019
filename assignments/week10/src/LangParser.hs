-- note that the parser must respect all the precedence and associativity rules expressed in the prettyShow function.
-- that means
-- ! binds more tightly than
-- * / which binds more tightly than
-- + - which binds more tightly than
-- && which binds more tightly than
-- || which binds more tightly than
-- : which binds more tightly than
-- {the application} which binds weakest of all

-- + - * / && || {the application} are left associative
-- : is right associative

-- we are mostly following the questionable c precedence rules

-- ungraded bonus: add additional pretty syntax for lists: [1,2,3,4]



-- for repl testing
