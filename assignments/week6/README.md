## Code Part
This is the same as the parsing section from HW4. Remember to copy any paste your answers to this directory if you are already done.

### Instructions
* Watch the hint videos: [Parser type](https://youtu.be/CNqEECXPU6c), [Parsing Library](https://youtu.be/XyRLWIQeWmo), [Write a Parser](https://youtu.be/fJ1QPEfmXi8)
* To get the assignment run ```git pull upstream master``` in your homework directory
* `cd` into the `week6` directory, run `cabal new-repl`
* Fill in the bodies of the undefined functions and data
* DO NOT CHANGE THE TYPE SIGNATURES!

### Notes
* all tests are posted
* If you do the optional part with the language evaluations, not that the ASTs for Lang3 and Lang4 have changed slightly.

### Submit (similar to [week1](../week1))
1. run the tests by running ```cabal new-test``` 
1. run ```git status``` to make sure git is ok
1. run ```git commit -a -m "parsing is fun"``` to make a commit to your laptop
1. run ```git pull upstream master``` to get the latest tests
1. run the tests by running ```cabal new-test``` 
1. run ```git push``` to submit your commit to your private gitHub account
1. check that you can see your solutions on the website for your private repo

### REPL hints
* `:load` or `:l` will change the module you are inspecting
* `:reload` or `:r` will reload the file.  Do this often!
* `:type` or `:t` will tell you the type of an expression
* `:quit` or `:q` will leave the repl
