-- good:
--  substitution
--  evaluation
--  easy to build up terms in haskell's syntax
-- bad:
--  lose var names
--  hard to do any introspection, show/debug, Eq, freeVars, isValue
--  can require more cleverness to work with
--  can put complex logic into the function that does not necessarily correspond to the Language.  This is less of an issue in this case since haskell is pure and turring complete, just like lambda calc
-- variations:
--  use polymorphism for FreeVar
