# Before You Begin


<h3>Overview</h3>

 <p>    Your last assignment for the semester will be a pure functional programming language
based on Haskell. You will create several interacting pieces of code which will, at minimum, 
parse and interpret expressions in the language, providing dynamic type checking and a number
of other features (e.g., data structures) which will make the language a minimal, but realistic
language in which you could write useful programs. Additional features will provide extended
	 functionality to make your language more flexible, useful, and productive for realistic
	 programming in the pure functional style. 
	
</p>
<p>
In future semesters, CS 320 will receive Hub units for teamwork and for creativity, and I intend
	to make this project a centerpiece of those activities. Hence, there will be an emphasis on
	team development of the project (though for this semester you may work alone) and a 
	context for integrating all that you have done this
	semester into a creative experience which hopefully will give you a taste of what real language
	designers do. 
</p>
	
<p> <b>This document will be updated as we work out some of the details; for now we are providing
	a description of the basic features required by all submissions (the "vanilla" version) so that you can get
	started if you wish; the other details will be worked out by the end of this week, so that you can
	start in earnest after the second midterm. Places where further information will be provided are marked by the
	abbreviation TBA (= "To Be Announced").

<dt><b> Team Organization </b></dt>
<p>
<dd><ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li> You are strongly encouraged to do this in a team, but may do it by yourself if you prefer. No teams of more than
three will be allowed.  
</li> 
<li>In the first milestone (see below) you must answer some questions about your team and the plan for completing the project by the deadline. 
</li>   
<li> Part of the final submission will be a "360 review" (such as performed in CS 411) in which each member will submit
an <i> anonymous </i> report/reflection on 
how the team performed and any issues that we need to know about when evaluating the final project. 
</li>
<li>  In the usual case, all team members will receive the same score out of 100 points, which will then be scaled to 5% of the final grade; details about the grading TBA, but it will involve a combination of a short written summary report, various deliverables, and
your  tests on your code. We will not be providing tests, as we don't know what your syntax is, but we will give you guidance about how to test it using hunit tests (used for the automated testing this term). 
</li>
<li> In the pathological case that there are problems with very unequal contribution to the final product, we reserve the
right to give reduced or no points to members who did not fulfill their obligation to the project; in such a case every
attempt will be made to make sure that the other members do not suffer a grading penalty because of the irresponsibility
of another team  member. 
</li>
